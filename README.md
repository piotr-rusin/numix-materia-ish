## Numix-Materia-ish
##### A fork of [Numix theme][original] with light menu and menubar colors, to be used as a base for my other forks of the original theme.

## Build It

First, you need to compile the theme using the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) compiler.

To install Sass, install Ruby and the gem command using your distribution's package manager. Then install `sass` with the `gem` command,

`gem install sass`

You'll also need the ```glib-compile-schemas``` and  ```gdk-pixbuf-pixdata``` commands in your path to generate the gresource binary. Install them using your distribution's package manager.

|Distro|Commands|
|:----:|:----:|
|![arch][arch] &nbsp;![antergos][antergos]|`sudo pacman -S glib2 gdk-pixbuf2`|
|![opensuse][opensuse]|`sudo zipper install glib2-devel gdk-pixbuf-devel`|
|![fedora][fedora]|`sudo dnf install glib2-devel gdk-pixbuf2-devel`|
|![debian][debian] &nbsp;![ubuntu][ubuntu]|`sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libxml2-utils`|

After installing all the dependencies, change to the cloned directory and, run the following in Terminal,

```sh
sudo make install
```

To set the theme in GNOME, run the following commands in Terminal,

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Numix-Lithium
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Numix-Lithium"
```

To set the theme in Xfce, run the following commands in Terminal,

```sh
xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Numix-Lithium"
xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -s "Numix-Lithium"
```

#### For developers
If you want to hack on the theme, make sure you have the `inotifywait` command available, which is used for watching and automatically building the files.

To start watching for changes, run the following,

```sh
make watch
```

If you change any assets, you'll need to regenerate the `gtk.gresource.xml` and `gtk.gresource` files. You can use [grrr](https://github.com/satya164/grrr) to do it easily.
